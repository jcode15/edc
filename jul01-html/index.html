  				<dd>The Walking Dead premiered in the U.S. on October 31, 2010, on the cable television channel AMC[5] and internationally in November 2010 on Fox International Channels.[6] AMC has renewed the series each year because of its consistently increasing Nielsen ratings which have been unprecedentedly high for a cable series, including averaging the most 18- to 49-year-old adult viewers of any cable or broadcast television series during its fourth and fifth seasons</dd>
