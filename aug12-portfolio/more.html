			<h1>Welcome!</h1> 
			<h2>To My More Page</h2>
			<p>If you notice my Portfolio page has all kinds of different themes, colors and backgrounds. This was done on purpose. Thought I kept the header mostly the same. I have mastered making exicting and great web pages. So everything in my portfolio is custom made. To kind of show I have other talents. Wheather normal or outside the box. You can always count on me.  If you have an idea that is outside the box. Well dont hesitate to contact me please. No matter how weird. </p>
			<p>This is where I will post more stufff about me or what I have learned or accomplish. But for now you will have to wait till I get there. Page may be a little empty till then :) I will be updating soon.</p>
